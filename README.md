### Hey there, I'm Robert Bates ðŸ‘‹
I recently graduated from PSU with a BS in Science and a minor in Computer Science. 
Currently, Iâ€™m completing the IOS Developer career path certificate on Codecademy while also looking for work as a developer.
I would treasure working as part of a team in an environment where I can continue to learn/grow, and I look forward to working with yours!
